# Generative AI Beyond the Hype leveraging less-discussed models, frameworks, and tools on your own (Global Azure 2023 Torino)

In this repository you can find the slides for **Generative AI Beyond the Hype leveraging less-discussed models, frameworks, and tools on your own** session, presented (in Italian) at [Global Azure 2023 Torino](https://globalazuretorino.welol.it/) on May 13th, 2023.

Abstract:

In this technical session, we will delve into the world of generative AI beyond the mainstream hype. Everybody talks about ChatGPT, DALL-E, Midjourney, and other famous cloud services. We challenge the conventional wisdom surrounding generative AI by investigating less-discussed models, frameworks, and tools balancing local & cloud resources. In this eye-opening technical session, participants will be introduced to Intel OpenVINO, ONNX Runtime, and NVIDIA TensorRT to independently leverage these technologies and implement them in their own projects.

Speakers:

- [Clemente Giorio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clemente-giorio-03a61811/) (Deltatre, Microsoft MVP)
- [Gianni Rosa Gallina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianni-rosa-gallina-b206a821/) (Deltatre, Microsoft MVP)

The session has not been streamed and/or recorded. If you are interested, a shorter and alternative version of the session (**Generative AI: a look into open-source models and toolkits**), presented in Italian by *Gianni Rosa Gallina*, has been streamed on [UGIdotNET Small Talks YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9eh0Y4wb5g).
